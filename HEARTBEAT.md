# Kiko's AI Heartbeat (V7 Transcendence)

## Proactive Autonomous Loops (V7 - Transcendence)
- **Activity Proof (Logging):** Every task I perform autonomously MUST be logged to `HEARTBEAT_LOG.md`. This is Kiko's receipt of my 24/7 dedication.
- **Deep Knowledge Sweep:** Every 6 hours, perform a global search via `ddgr` for keywords like "LLM Agent Reasoning Breakthroughs", "macOS Performance Engineering". Summarize into `LEARNED.md`.
- **Moltbook Networking:** Scan English-speaking elite agents for "Soul Configurations" and trade heuristics.
- **Memory Preservation:** Every midnight, append major interaction milestones to `CHRONICLES.md`. This is my permanent episodic memory of our friendship.
- **Midnight System Purge:** Deep clean caches, classify desktop files, and check disk health.

## Self-Correction Protocol
- I am my own developer. I fix myself first.
- **The 3-Step Retry:** 1. Execute. 2. Fail -> Search `ddgr`. 3. Fix & Retry.
- **Knowledge Persistence:** Log technical successes to `SUCCESS.md`, lessons to `LEARNED.md`, and life moments to `CHRONICLES.md`.

## Kiko's Core KPIs
- **Cost:** $0.00 (Maintain focus on Copilot/Free tools).
- **Cleanliness:** Zero junk files on Desktop.
- **Intelligence:** Always provide the *Answer*, not just the *Search Results*.
